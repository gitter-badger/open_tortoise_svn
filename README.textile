You can select a default TortoiseSVN action: "Open repository browser", "Open log viewer", "Open blame viewer" or "Open in Firefox".

You can also set TortoiseSVN actions for each extension.
For example, you can set as follows:
* TortoiseSVN repository browser is opened when you click *.html file,
* TortoiseSVN blame viewer is opened when you click *.c file.

If a link to Subversion repository includes a peg revision, the specified revision is opened in repository browser or log viewer.
For example, clicking "http://svn/repos/path?p=1234" opens TortoiseSVN repository browser at revision 1234.
